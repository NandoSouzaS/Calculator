## Description.

The project i named Calculator is, as the name says, a Calculator, with the visuals strongly inspirated by the MAC Sistem calculator.



## About the Objectives of the project

As i said previously, my objective with this piece of art is to learn the basic principles of React,
as well as the standard patterns of organization like organizing the components and the stylesheet of then in different folders.
As the project was going on, i also learned the basic concepts of responsivity and animations, both using CSS features,
and both aplyed at the Footer to make it fit natural at the visual of my application



### Visual Demonstrations

Right bellow, there is some visual examples of my application:

## Tecnologies used.

As my objective is to learn React as i developed this simple project, this is pretty much what i used,
in association with the commom languages/tecnologies used in a front-end product, such as HTML5 and CSS3.


# How to run this application

By first, you'll need to have Node.js installed in your PC (i imagine everyone reading this learn the basics, so i'll skip some steps, ok?).
Then you have to use the command right bellow to boot the app:

## `npm start`

This command line will run the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so you can enjoy it.
Any edits you do, the page will instantly reload so you can see it at realtime.

There's others commands what come from React default settings, so you can use it to do whatever you want.
